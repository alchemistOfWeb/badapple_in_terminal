### Class task

You are given a video. Using OpenCV, create a .py file, which after running will display the video itself in the terminal. (On windows the animation my be a bit buggy, so try to test out the final version on any unix systems)

### Homework

Using the same video you used in class, mask out the background to be any picture you want, while all the white objects (including the character herself) will change their color to something visible (depending on the picture you chose).
